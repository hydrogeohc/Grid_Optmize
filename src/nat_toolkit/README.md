# Unified NAT Grid Toolkit

**Complete NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Integration for Power Grid Optimization**

## Overview

This unified toolkit combines the functionality of the original `nat_grid_toolkit` and `nat_grid_workflow` into a single, comprehensive NAT integration that provides:

- ✅ **Modern NAT Functions** - Advanced grid optimization capabilities
- ✅ **Legacy Compatibility** - Backward compatibility with existing workflows
- ✅ **Unified Configuration** - Single configuration supporting all features
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Support** - React and Reasoning agents
- ✅ **Enterprise Ready** - Production-grade security and reliability

## Functions

### Modern Functions (Recommended)

#### `grid_optimize(region: str)`
Advanced grid optimization with comprehensive analysis and reporting.

```python
# Usage example
result = await grid_optimize("us-west")
```

**Features:**
- Real-time optimization algorithms
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Safety validation and compliance
- Detailed reporting with metrics

#### `grid_status(region: str)`
Real-time grid monitoring and status reporting.

```python
# Usage example  
status = await grid_status("us-west")
```

**Features:**
- Current load and capacity monitoring
- Active alerts and maintenance schedules
- Historical optimization data
- Performance metrics

#### `grid_analyze(region: str, metric: str)`
Advanced performance analysis with predictive insights.

```python
# Usage example
analysis = await grid_analyze("us-west", "efficiency")
```

**Features:**
- Trend analysis across time periods
- Comparative performance metrics
- Predictive insights and recommendations
- Historical data analysis

### Legacy Functions (Backward Compatibility)

#### `nat_grid_optimization/optimize_grid(region: str)`
Legacy grid optimization function - redirects to modern implementation.

#### `nat_grid_optimization/show_last_optimization(region: str)`
Legacy optimization results display - uses modern status system.

## Configuration Files

### `configs/config.yml`
Modern NAT toolkit configuration with all advanced features.

### `configs/config-reasoning.yml`  
Advanced reasoning agent configuration for complex scenarios.

### `configs/unified-config.yml`
Complete unified configuration supporting both modern and legacy functions.

## Usage Examples

### Modern Approach (Recommended)
```bash
# Use modern functions
aiq run --config_file src/nat_toolkit/configs/config.yml \
        --input "Optimize the grid for region us-west"
```

### Legacy Compatibility
```bash
# Legacy functions still work
aiq run --config_file configs/workflow.yml \
        --input "Use nat_grid_optimization/optimize_grid for us-west"
```

### Advanced Reasoning
```bash
# Complex analysis with reasoning
aiq run --config_file src/nat_toolkit/configs/config-reasoning.yml \
        --input "Analyze grid efficiency and recommend optimization strategy"
```

## Migration Guide

### From nat_grid_toolkit
- ✅ **No changes required** - All functions work as before
- ✅ **Enhanced features** - Additional capabilities available
- ✅ **Same configurations** - Existing configs remain valid

### From nat_grid_workflow
- ✅ **Automatic compatibility** - Legacy functions redirect to new implementation
- ✅ **Improved performance** - Modern async implementation
- ✅ **Enhanced reporting** - Better formatted output with more details
